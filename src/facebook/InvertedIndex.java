 * 
 * 	{0} - "Turtles love pizza"
	{1} - "I love my turtles"
	{2} - "My pizza is good"
 * 
 * Then you would store them in a Inverted Indexes like this:

            	Record Level     Fully Inverted
	"turtles"   {0, 1}           { (0, 0), (1, 3) }
	"love"      {0, 1}           { (0, 1), (1, 1) }
	"pizza"     {0, 2}           { (0, 2), (2, 1) }
	"i"         {1}              { (1, 0) }
	"my"        {1, 2}           { (1, 2), (2, 0) }
	"is"        {2}              { (2, 2) }
	"good"      {2}              { (2, 3) }
 *  	The intersection becomes a more interesting problem. 
 *  	First, you can try using Bloom Filters if accuracy isnâ€™t 100% needed, 
 *  	Second, you can brute force the problem by doing a full scan of each set for O(M+N) time for joining two sets.

Doc1:
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.
Doc2:
Buffalo are mammals.
we could construct the following inverted file index:
Buffalo -> Doc1, Doc2
buffalo -> Doc1
buffalo. -> Doc1
are -> Doc2
mammals. -> Doc2
